**Unit 12: Performance** <span id="12"></span> 
*Like Installation Art, Performance Art engages more senses than sight
alone. Unlike traditional theater, it is often presented in art spaces
such as museums, galleries, and studios. It may also make use of public
spaces, factories, warehouses, or private homes. Performance Art may or
may not have a clearly identifiable plot or narrative; it may encourage
audience participation; it might include a number of different media
such as live performers, painting, music, writing, video, or dance. In
other words, there are virtually no limits on the creator’s imagination.
Similarly, the artists’ reasons for producing Performance Art vary
greatly. Performance artists may attempt to break down the barriers
between art and life or between public and private experience; their
works may shock the viewer into new perceptions of the social situation;
or performances may engage viewers in multisensory experiences.*
