**Unit 15: Themes in Late 20<sup>th</sup>-Century and early
21<sup>st</sup> Century Art** <span id="15"></span> 
*The art produced in the closing decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
and the early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century continues to
emphasize many of the themes we’ve explored in this course: art’s
relationship to the changes and stresses of contemporary life, the role
of the artist, experimentation and innovation in materials and
processes, and the desire to destroy old oppositions (such as high art
versus low culture, male versus female, spiritual versus material, and
objectivity versus subjectivity).*  
    
 *This era has been characterized as one that has a more global
perspective on art and culture, one that no longer privileges the art of
the West over that of all the rest. This new perspective is the result
of a global market economy as well as the phenomenal growth in the
Internet and related technologies, such as personal websites, smart
phones, and social networking sites.*  
    
 *This unit explores a few of the major artists of this period. As you
consider their works, look for similarities and differences with the art
of the earlier 20<sup>th</sup> century. What connections can you find
with earlier themes in modern or postmodern art? What is new in the art
of the later 20<sup>th</sup> century? Does your newly gained knowledge
of 20<sup>th</sup>-century art help you to interpret the art of the
current moment?*
