**Unit 2: Fauvism and Cubism** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Fauvism and Cubism
brought extraordinary innovation and experimentation to the visual arts.
The Fauves, led by Henri Matisse and strongly influenced by the
Post-Impressionists, favored vivid nonnaturalistic colors, simplified
decorative lines, and flatter pictorial space. The Cubists, led by Pablo
Picasso and Georges Braque, were influenced primarily by Paul Cézanne.
In Cubism’s initial phase, known as Analytic Cubism, objects seemed to
be shattered into geometric planes splayed across the canvas, making it
difficult to recognize the subject matter and emphasizing the
essentially two-dimensional nature of the canvas’s surface. In the
second phase, called Synthetic Cubism, the colors became brighter and
the objects more identifiable, but the emphasis on flatness remained.
Picasso and Braque began to introduce nonart materials into their work
as they experimented with collage and constructed, rather than carved or
modeled, their sculptures.*  
    
 *Most of the artists associated with Fauvism and Cubism were also
inspired by the highly stylized sculptures of various African countries.
Due to the colonizing enterprises of France, Belgium, and Germany, the
artists were able to see such artifacts in public and private
collections in Europe. The abstracted forms of these African objects
encouraged the artists in their movement away from naturalistic
representation and toward greater abstraction. It helped them realize
that there were alternative artistic conventions and styles available.
For many artists, these non-Western objects functioned as a new source
of originality. Some artists used elements borrowed from non-Western
traditions in order to critique the social and artistic conventions of
modern, Western society*.

    Apollinaire was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Cubist
    painting. He realized many viewers found this kind of painting
    difficult to appreciate as it lacked the clearly identifiable
    subject matter and highly finished style of Salon paintings.
    Apollinaire explained the artists’ move away from nature by
    comparing it to music. He also argued that these paintings replaced
    the old value of verisimilitude with the new values of austerity and
    purity.
