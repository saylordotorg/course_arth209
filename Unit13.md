**Unit 13: Identity Politics: Feminism and Social Activism** <span
id="13"></span> 
*In the 1960s and 1970s, European and American societies experienced a
sea change. Numerous individuals and organizations reacted against
patriarchal culture, that is, a culture that privileged white
heterosexual males and that denigrated the productions of women and
people of color. The Civil Rights Movement and the Feminist Movement
sought to redress the balance and to bring the concerns of marginalized
groups into the mainstream art world. The artists discussed in this unit
created works that specifically address the political implications of
individual gender and ethnic identity.*
