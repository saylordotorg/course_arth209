**Unit 3: Futurism, German Expressionism, and Brancusi** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore further developments in modernist art in
the 1910s. We start with Futurism, a radical avant-garde movement that
emerged in Milan, Italy, in 1909. The Futurists wanted to create an art
that would definitively break away from the past, one that would instead
convey the speed and dynamism of modern urban and industrial life. The
German Expressionists consisted of two groups: Die Brücke (The Bridge)
and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). Both groups valued the art of
non-Western and premodern cultures; both used increasingly abstract
styles and strong colors to emphasize the artist’s personal
expressivity. The Rumanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi, working
primarily in France, developed a streamlined form of abstraction that
combined references to Rumanian folk art with intimations of the
spiritual.*

     Instructions: Please scroll down the page and click on “Wassily
    Kandinsky: Excerpts from *Concerning the Spiritual in Art*” and read
    this piece. In this book, Kandinsky claimed that the formal elements
    of art—color, line, shape, and composition—could have a direct
    effect on the human soul. This meant that artists could be spiritual
    leaders in the increasingly materialistic societies of the modern
    world. It also suggested that art was a universal means of
    communication, one that could transcend national and cultural
    boundaries. These excerpts illuminate his passionate commitment to
    utopian goals for art. After you have read them, take another look
    at the images in the Art Story’s “Wassily Kandinsky” reading earlier
    in this section. In your opinion, how successfully did Kandinsky
    convey his ideas in his art works?
