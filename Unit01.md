**Unit 1: The Roots of 20<sup>th</sup>-Century Modernist Art:
Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau and Rodin** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This unit presents a brief summary of major developments that occurred
during the last three decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and paved
the way for 20<sup>th</sup>-century modernist art. Art historians argue
about how far back in history we see the origins of
20<sup>th</sup>-century art. Some suggest going as far back as the
French Revolution of 1789; others view the 1855 Paris exhibition as the
pivotal turn to modern themes; and still others consider the 1863 Salon
des Refuses to be the beginning of the major changes associated with
modernism. However, it is undisputable that the year 1874 marked one of
the most decisive turns in the history of Western art with the emergence
of the Impressionist movement, which we will adapt as a starting point
in our discussion of modern art in this course.*  
  
 *The Impressionists are considered modern partly because they
consciously reacted against prior artistic styles and traditions. They
rejected the ideal and supposedly eternal subject matter preferred by
the Salon in France and the Royal Academy in England in favor of more
contemporary subjects. They also challenged the authority of these
institutions by organizing their own, nonjuried art exhibitions. The
composition, color, and brushwork they used in their paintings seemed
radically different from that of their famous predecessors. We then
explorePost-Impressionism and Art Nouveau, two other modernist trends
that emerged in the last decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and
built on the Impressionists’ innovations in style and content. Last, we
consider the work of the French sculptor, Auguste Rodin, and the
elements that mark his sculptures as distinctly modern.*
