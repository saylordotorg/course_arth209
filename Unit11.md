**Unit 11: Postmodernism** <span id="11"></span> 
*Postmodernism is a notoriously slippery term and numerous art
historians and critics have defined it in slightly different ways. Most
would agree, however, that postmodernist works either revise or critique
the values associated with modernism. These modernist values include
originality, authenticity of expression, individuality, purity, and the
fine arts’ ability to transcend the material world. Many postmodernist
artists instead privilege the idea of the copy over the original; they
argue that all expression is culturally determined rather than a matter
of individual creativity; and they reject the hierarchy that places the
fine arts above all other forms of human production.*  
  

*The readings in subunit 11.1 will help you gain a better understanding
of postmodernism in general. Subunit 11.2 examines the works and ideas
of several major postmodernist artists. As you work through this
material, note the various strategies that each artist uses and think
about what makes these works postmodernist. What do these works convey
about originality or the possibility of individual expression? What do
they suggest about the relationship between high art and popular,
consumer culture? *

    Barthes”](http://www.ubu.com/aspen/aspen5and6/threeEssays.html#barthes) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the first link on the page, “The Death of
    the Author/Roland Barthes,” and read this essay. This is a
    challenging essay, written in 1967 by one of the most influential
    theorists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Take your time and take
    notes. Barthes was a French semiologist, that is, he studied signs,
    symbols, and systems of representation, such as language,
    literature, and the visual arts. In this essay, Barthes claimed that
    traditional criticism mistakenly viewed the author or producer of a
    work of art as the creator of the work’s meanings. Critics, he said,
    looked to the biography and personality of the author in order to
    explain the text or to find clues to its meanings. Instead, Bathes
    privileged the reader as the ultimate interpreter and definer of
    meaning. Furthermore, Barthes suggested that there is no such thing
    as true originality, as each individual is simply a product of his
    or her language and culture. Although this essay focuses on literary
    works of art, his ideas were very influential on many visual artists
    and critics.  
        
     Reading this essay should take approximately 45 minutes.
