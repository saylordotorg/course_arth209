**Unit 7: The 1940s and 1950s in the United States and Europe** <span
id="7"></span> 
*One of the most striking developments of the 1940s and 1950s was the
rise of New York City as a major artistic center. This was partly due to
the large number of European modernists who fled to the United States
during and after World War II. It was also fueled by the United States’s
new role as a world leader.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will explore the rise of Abstract Expressionism in
the United States and the part it played in America’s new artistic
prominence. We will also examine several critical approaches that have
been used to interpret the art of this movement. Then we will turn our
attention to Art Brut and European modernism in this period. As you work
through this unit, remember to compare the works of art under discussion
with earlier examples of abstract art and to look for similarities and
differences in the styles, the artistic motivations, and the meanings
conveyed by the works.*

    Kitsch”](http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Clement Greenberg was one of the most influential
    critics of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. His critical method came to
    be known as “formalism,” because he emphasized that only the formal
    elements (line, color, shape, composition, spatial arrangements,
    etc.) in a work of art were necessary or important. These, he
    claimed, were the elements that set visual works apart from all
    other forms of human production. Recognizable subject matter and
    narratives or stories were no longer necessary or valuable. In this
    essay, written in 1939 when fascist or totalitarian regimes were
    gaining strength and power in Europe, Greenberg outlined his reasons
    for privileging abstract over naturalistic works of art. He believed
    that art, as he defined it, was the only way to save culture from
    the threatening political forces of the time. As you read this
    essay, make note of his arguments and their social and political, as
    well as aesthetic, implications. How does he define avant-garde art?
    How does he characterize kitsch? Some critics have argued that
    Greenberg’s formalist approach is elitist as it seems to suggest
    that “true” art is only for the educated connoisseur. Would you
    agree with this assessment?  
        
     Reading this essay and answering the questions should take
    approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes.
