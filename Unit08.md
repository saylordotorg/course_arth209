**Unit 8: Neo-Dada and Pop Art** <span id="8"></span> 
*In the 1950s, a number of artists in the United States and Europe began
to react against the abstract styles, expressive brushwork, and
metaphysical meanings associated with earlier 20<sup>th</sup>-century
modern art in general and Abstract Expressionism and Art Brut in
particular. The artists associated with Neo-Dada and Pop Art were
inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s cool, intellectual approach to art and his
use of common, everyday materials. Like Duchamp, they were interested in
breaking down the boundaries between the fine arts and everyday life.
Neo-Dada and Pop artists also looked to American popular culture for
subject matter: comic books, Hollywood films, magazines, and advertising
imagery became important sources for them.*  
    
 *In the decades immediately after World War II, the European nations
that had been involved in the struggle were slow to recover from the
war’s economic toll. The United States, however, experienced rapidly
increasing prosperity and an explosion of growth in mass culture and
consumerism. This, along with America’s newly won position as a powerful
world leader, led to the exportation of American culture around the
globe. The Neo-Dada and Pop artists shared a fascination with American
popular culture, but the meanings evoked by their works vary greatly. As
you work through this unit, consider the attitudes toward popular
culture and consumerism that are conveyed. Do the works seem to embrace
and celebrate pop culture? Do they seem to criticize it? Do they convey
a desire to escape from materialism or a hope for transcendence? What
elements in the works themselves support your views?*

    podcast. Dr. Willette discusses the historical situation in which
    Pop Art arose in England and the United States as well as Pop Art’s
    new attitudes, materials, and subjects. Please pay close attention
    to her discussion of Pop Art’s relation to reality and systems of
    representation. All forms of visual representation—painting,
    sculpture, comic books, advertising, photographs, and so forth—are
    sign systems. That is, each follows certain conventions for
    representing the real world. Pop artists, Dr. Willette argues,
    realized that they could freely borrow from any of these sign
    systems, thereby breaking down the boundaries between high art and
    mass culture.
