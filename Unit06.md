**Unit 6: The “Return to Order” in France, Germany, and the United
States** <span id="6"></span> 
*We’ve see that much of the art of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century was
characterized by the breakdown of forms, nonnaturalistic colors, crude
drawing, asymmetrical compositions, and a move toward abstraction. Some
of these works—such as those by the German Expressionists—conveyed
anxiety over the rapid and radical transformations of modern life;
others—such as those by the Futurists—celebrated modernity’s speed and
dynamism and welcomed the destruction of the past and its traditions.
After World War I, there was a shift in styles and attitudes as artists
reacted to the social and political chaos caused by the conflict.
Simplicity, legibility, and rational order became highly valued artistic
attributes. Scholars have loosely described this as a desire for a
“return to order.”*  
    
 *In this unit, we will see how these new values appeared in France,
Germany, and the United States. In France, the Purists produced
paintings with clearly defined objects and stable compositions in order
to evoke the same sense of harmony and balance found in classical works
of art. In Germany, the artists of the Bauhaus tried to design works
that would be suitable for mass production, while the New Objectivity
artists focused on social and political critiques that would be easily
understood by the public. In the United States, the Precisionists,
Regionalists, and Urban Realists emphasized clarity of form and
recognizably American subject matter. As you work through this unit, pay
particular attention to the similarities and differences in the artistic
styles, social goals, and motivations of these artists.*

     Instructions: Click on “1 audio stop 930” at the top of the page to
    hear curator Michael Taylor discuss Fernand Leger’s painting, *The
    City*, 1919. Then click on “Teacher Resources” at the top of the
    page to read an essay about this work and more about this artist.
    Note how Leger’s style relates to earlier artistic styles as well as
    the increasingly industrial cityscape.  
        
     Reading the essay and listening to the recording should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    Architecture”](http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/Design%20History/Design_readings/) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link, “LeCorbuNewArch.pdf,” and read the
    first 3.5 pages, up until “The Engineer’s Aesthetic and
    Architecture.” Although this essay deals with architecture, the
    ideas that Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (popularly known as Le
    Corbusier) outlines here were enormously influential in all of the
    visual arts. Basically, Le Corbusier attempts to reconcile spiritual
    expression in the arts with the rationality and logical calculation
    required by industrial production. Note the values that he
    emphasizes here: simplicity, geometry, clarity, rational order, and
    logical analysis. For Le Corbusier, these values will result in
    human creations that adhere to supposedly “universal laws” and
    result in harmony. As you work through the rest of the material in
    this unit, note how many other artists espouse similar values and
    goals for their art.

     Instructions: Click on the link “GropiusBau.pdf,” and read the
    document. Gropius, like Le Corbusier, writes about the need to
    reconcile art as a spiritual expression with the industrial
    production of useful goods. Note the similarities in goals and
    values between Gropius and Le Corbusier. While both emphasize the
    practicalities of designing for mass production, they also have
    rather utopian goals in that they see art, architecture, and crafts
    as a way to improve human life.

**6.3 The United States: The Armory Show and American Realism** <span
id="6.3"></span> 
*The Armory Show of 1913 was the first major exhibition of modern
European art in the United States. The European artists’ move away from
naturalistic representation shocked both the American critics and the
American public. After seeing this show, many American artists were
inspired and emboldened to experiment even more freely with abstract
form, nonnaturalistic color, expressive brushwork, and new materials.  
*  
 *During the period between the world wars, a number of American artists
turned away from the extreme abstraction displayed at the Armory Show
and instead chose to convey modern themes through more naturalistic, and
therefore more easily understandable, styles. As with Purism in France
and the New Objectivity in Germany, Precisionism, Regionalism, and Urban
Realism in the United States have been interpreted in terms of a desire
for a “return to order” after the chaos and carnage of World War I.*  
  
 *The artists associated with Precisionism used hard-edged styles, flat
colors, and predominantly geometric forms to depict the human-made
environment. Regionalist artists focused on the themes and subjects of
American rural life in various areas of the nation, while Urban Realists
favored depictions of metropolitan life.*
