**Unit 10: Conceptual, Installation, and Land Art** <span
id="10"></span> 
*Conceptual, Installation, and Land Art all strove to go beyond the
traditional categories of painting and sculpture. Conceptual Art, as the
name implies, privileged the idea or conception of a work over the
execution of a beautiful object. The emphasis was placed on intellectual
activity rather than aesthetic enjoyment. Many Conceptual works
incorporate language or mathematical constructs in works often made from
nonartistic materials. Installation art subverted the categories of
painting and sculpture by creating large-scale works that transform the
viewers’ perception of a specific site or space. These works may include
any combination of artistic and nonartistic materials and processes. The
artists associated with Land Art, also known as Earth Art, abandoned
their studio spaces and began to work outdoors. These artists used the
earth itself—dirt, rocks, bodies of water, and weather—to create often
monumental works that are subject to the depredations of time and
climate.*  
    
 *As you work through the material in the unit, consider these
questions: How do these works relate to the spaces in which they are
presented? How do they affect the relationship between the work of art
and the viewer? How do they redefine the function of art and the role of
the artist?*
