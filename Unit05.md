**Unit 5: Dada and Surrealism** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit focuses on Dada and Surrealism during the period from 1917 to
1930. Like the artists associated with Suprematism and Constructivism in
Russia and De Stijl in Holland, the artists associated with Dada and
Surrealism were strongly influenced by the horrors of World War I as
well as by earlier modernist artistic styles.*  
  
 *Like the Futurists, Dada artists enjoyed provoking their audiences,
but Dada works often contained more obvious political critiques. Dada’s
primary goal was to attack and subvert all the social norms and artistic
conventions of modern bourgeois culture, a culture Dadaists blamed for
the war’s devastation. Dada was more of an anti-art and
anti-establishment philosophy rather than a cohesive aesthetic style.
Its practitioners were active in Zurich, Paris, New York, Berlin,
Cologne, and Hanover, and Dada had slightly different flavors in each
city.*  
  
 *Surrealism arose in Paris in the early 1920s and included writers as
well as painters, sculptors, and photographers. The Surrealists rejected
bourgeois rationality and preferred the mysterious workings of the
unconscious mind, such as dreams. They experimented with a number of
automatic processes for creating art in order to escape cultural
conventions and to tap into something they thought would be more
authentic and primitive. Many of their works emphasize the bizarre or
erotic aspects of reality.*

    Manifesto”**
    Link: University of Alabama: André Breton’s [“First Surrealist
    Manifesto”](http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T340/SurrealismLecture.php)

     Instructions: Please scroll down to the section headed “First
    Surrealist Manifesto (1924),” click on “a PDF-format version” and
    read up to the heading “Secrets of the Magical Surrealist Art.”
    Breton, like many of his contemporaries, thought that Western
    society’s overreliance on rationalism was one of the factors that
    led to the destruction of World War I. Like some of the artists
    associated with Suprematism, Constructivism, and De Stijl, Breton
    had utopian ideas about the function of art and the role of the
    artist in modern society. He, too, believed that art could have a
    direct and beneficial effect on everyday life. Note the importance
    Breton assigns to the imagination, the world of dreams, and
    unconscious thought. Think about how he defines Surrealism and what
    values he associates with this concept.
