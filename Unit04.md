**Unit 4: Suprematism, Constructivism, and De Stijl** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore the development of abstract art in Russia
and Holland in the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In
Russia, the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 led to a flowering of modernist
styles. Many Russian artists believed the revolution would lead to a
better life for all Russians and were eager to show how the visual arts
could help transform society. Kazimir Malevich, the founder of
Suprematism, created a radically simplified style that valued simplicity
and purity. Malevich wanted to break with the art of the past and create
works that could convey both rationality and spirituality. The
Constructivists also sought a simplified style, one that they hoped
would eventually be used to mass produce aesthetically pleasing objects
for everyday life. In Holland, the artists associated with De Stijl (The
Style) shared the Russians’ interests in simplicity, purity,
rationality, and spirituality. Like their Russian contemporaries, Dutch
artists Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg held the utopian belief that
art could transform everyday life. The destruction caused by the first
World War (1914–1918) was a major impetus for all these artists.
Repulsed by the war’s carnage, they hoped to create art that would help
humanity build better societies, thereby creating new and important
social roles for themselves*.
