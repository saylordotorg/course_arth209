Course Syllabus for "ARTH209: 20<sup>th</sup> Century Art"
----------------------------------------------------------

This course explores the history of the artistic developments of the
20<sup>th</sup> century in Western Europe and the United States. The art
of this period is characterized by extraordinary experimentation and
innovation in styles, materials, techniques, and modes of dissemination.
In addition to painting and sculpture, the 20<sup>th</sup> century
witnessed the rise in popularity of photography, collage, montage,
installations, earth art, performance, and conceptual art. Artists were
sometimes inspired by the works of past masters but also often by
contemporary changes in intellectual thought and social conditions.
Therefore, we will examine the intellectual and cultural beliefs that
this art both reflects and helped shape. Despite the great variety of
artistic styles and theories that we will examine, a number of important
themes consistently recur. If you keep them in mind as you progress
through the course, you will find it easier to organize your thoughts
and make meaningful comparisons among various artists, movements, and
art works. These themes include:
-   reactions to the conditions of modern life (such as urbanism,
    industrialism, secularization, new technologies, colonialism, and
    identity politics);
-   a shift from objectivity to subjectivity that includes a movement
    away from the naturalistic representation of objects in the world to
    a more subjective, abstracted depiction of ideas or feelings;
-   the search for a meaningful role for the artist in society as a
    spiritual or political leader as well as an aesthetic innovator;
-   a desire to destroy old oppositions such as fine versus applied
    arts; male versus female; spiritual versus material; art versus
    life; and the Western self versus the non-Western other; and
-   changes in the art market and the rise in importance of galleries
    and artist-run exhibitions.

Material is presented in chronological order and covers the period
between 1870 and the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. You will be
introduced to a variety of terms that art historians use to describe
styles, techniques, materials, and aesthetic concepts. Use the [ArtLex
Art Dictionary](http://www.artlex.com/) every time you come across a new
term that needs clarification. Terms of Use: Please respect the
copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.

**Time Commitment**: You will need approximately 105 hours to complete
the course. Each unit includes a Time Advisory that lists the amount of
time you can expect to spend on each subunit. These advisories should
help you efficiently plan your time. You may find it useful to look at
the Time Advisories first and determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit. It is a good idea to create a
schedule for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you a total of 15
hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (3 hours) on Monday night, subunit 1.2 (3 hours) on
Wednesday night, and so forth. A schedule will help to ensure that you
meet your goals and complete the course within a reasonable time.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions**: Please follow the directions in each unit of the
Content Outline section to navigate through the course materials. Please
read all of the assigned materials. You will find it helpful to take
careful notes as you work through the readings, video lectures, and
other resources. These notes will be invaluable resources for the final
exam. Please see the prerequisites in the Course Requirements section
above. If you are struggling with a concept, it may help to refer back
to this course for a refresher on artistic styles, processes, and
interpretive tools. The ArtLex Art Dictionary noted in the Purpose of
Course section above is also a useful reference for brief descriptions
of individual artists, styles, movements, and concepts.  
  
 Most importantly, try to think critically as you go through the
material. You can achieve this by trying to answer the following
questions:  

-   What were the artist’s or the movement’s goals and how successful
    was the artist or movement in achieving them?
-   What were the significant innovations in style, technique,
    materials, subject matter, or mode of exhibition?
-   How do the works of art relate to the social and historical
    situation in which they were produced?
-   What similarities and differences can you find among the various
    modern artists or art movements?
-   How is each example of modern art similar to or different from the
    art of the past?
-   What inspired or influenced each of the artists or movements and
    why?
