**Unit 14: Consumer Culture: Celebrations and Critiques** <span
id="14"></span> 
*Like the Pop artists in the 1960s, some artists in the 1980s produced
works that specifically comment upon art’s position within contemporary
consumer culture. Some incorporated text into their works in order to
speak clearly and directly to social or political concerns. Other
artists used techniques borrowed from industry to highlight the
relationship between works of art and other commodities intended for
sale on the open market. As with the earlier Pop works, it can be
difficult to determine if the work is meant to celebrate or to criticize
consumer culture. This ambiguity is often a deliberate strategy: It
forces viewers to consider the issues raised and to come to their own
conclusions.*
