**Unit 9: Minimalism, Process Art, and Arte Povera** <span
id="9"></span> 
*Minimalism, Process Art, and Arte Povera all began in the 1960s and all
of them used either nonartistic materials or nontraditional methods for
making art. Minimalism—also known as ABC Art, Primary Structures, or
Specific Objects—tended to favor simple geometric forms, unmodulated
colors, and serial repetition. Unlike the earlier geometric abstraction
of artists such as Piet Mondrian or Kasimir Malevich, Minimalist works
seemed to be devoid of any utopian goals for art. Instead, the
Minimalist works refer to industrial production or emphasize the formal
qualities of the materials themselves. As the name implies, Process
artists emphasized the processes used to create a work of art rather
than the final object. The artist’s actions on the material—pouring,
folding, tearing, welding, smearing, spraying, pasting, and so forth—are
clearly visible. Often these artists, like the Minimalists, preferred to
use nonart materials such as latex, rope, textiles, and ordinary metals.
Arte Povera—literally “Poor Art”—favored commonplace materials in works
that seem to reject the technology of modern times and instead evoke a
pre-industrial aesthetic.*  
    
 *As you work through this unit, compare the artists’ use of materials,
methods of production, and goals for their art. What similarities and
differences can you find with earlier abstract art?*
